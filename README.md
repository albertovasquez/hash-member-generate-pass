# Final Code React and Walletconnect w/Moralis

This project was bootstrapped with CreateReactApp --scripts-version 4.0.3 so to have Webpack V4 and avoid any compatibility issues with [react-moralis package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-moralis#create-react-app).

Create React App Configuration Override [CRACO](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@craco/craco) is needed for [Tailwindcss V2.2.19](https://v2.tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/create-react-app)
